Eric Rojas is a new PhD student at Oregon State University working with Seth Zippel and Jenny Hutchings. Eric is working with data on the SASSIE Project to better understand salinity and sea-ice processes in polar regions. These interactions are influenced by air-sea interaction, upper ocean and ocean surface processes, as well as changes in climate. Outside the lab, he likes to play racquetball, go hiking, and read.
